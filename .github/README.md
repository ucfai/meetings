# SIGAI Meetings

In this repo, you'll find all the SIGAI@UCF lectures and workshops, categorized by semester. This should also have certain aspects that jive well with our Jekyll site ([ucfsigai.github.io](https://github.com/ucfsigai/ucfsigai.github.io/)).

## Installation Instructions
To get things up and running, all you need to have Docker installed on your machine.  **(If you don't, see [Dependencies](#dependencies).)** Once you've guaranteed that...
1. `cd meetings`
1. `sh .docker/run.sh <semester>` to get the container setup; `<semester>` should take the form... `faXX` for Fall and `spXX` for Spring, `XX` should be the last two digits of the year. (There are build tools, as well; but these are really intended for the coordinators.)
1. Open `localhost:19972` in your browser and navigate to the semester you'd like to view.
